# Skiodock
A chrome extension designed to be used with the [Chromebook Skiovox Exploit](https://github.com/3kh0/ext-remover?tab=readme-ov-file#skiovox-unrestricted-browsing) that aims to replicate the original ChromeOS dock

**This extension is a work in progress and is in a VERY buggy state**

## Known Issues (listed from most to least severe)
- Quite a few websites are broken. I'm not quite sure why at the moment but it's something to do with the JS.
- The Files and Settings app don't work
- The dock adds space to the bottom of each page (pretty sure this is another easy fix, but again, I don't have the energy to fix it currently)

If you find any other bugs it would be really helpful if you submitted them to the issues tab! Also if you find any solutions to these bugs, feel free to make a pull request!

## Future Plans
- Currently the functionality of the dock is very limited, currently the only use being to glance at the time and date, in the future I'm planning to bring back a lot more features of the dock
- The dock will automatically hide and show itself in the future
